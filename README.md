# corona
Analysis of corona compounds from the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus. These files accompany the CLARIN 2020 presentation entitled *Contagious “corona” compounding in a CLARIN newspaper monitor corpus* by Koenraad De Smedt.

## The main result data files are the following:

*korona-freq.csv* = frequency list of items, ordered by decreasing frequency

*korona-compounds.csv* = new types by date of first occurrence, also including source

These character separated files have TAB as field separator.

The items in these lists are types occurring as final parts of compounds; in other words, the initial part corona/korona and possible hyphens have been stripped from the compounds before processing.
